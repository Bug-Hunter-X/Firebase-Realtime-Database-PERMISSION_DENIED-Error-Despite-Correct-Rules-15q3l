# Firebase Realtime Database PERMISSION_DENIED Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Firebase where a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error occurs even when security rules appear to be correctly set up. The root cause often lies in a mismatch between the client's authentication state and what the security rules expect. This example showcases the problem and its solution.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file shows code attempting to read data from the Realtime Database. Despite correctly configured security rules (assumed), it throws a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error.  This occurs when there is an authentication issue.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version ensuring proper authentication before attempting database operations. This is the primary way to resolve these issues.  Double-check your authentication implementation.
